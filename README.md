## 🧱 Methodology

The study employs a **systematic review and analytical approach**, integrating findings from recent publications and industrial standards.

**Key steps:**
1. **Threat Classification:** Using NIST and ISO/IEC 27017 frameworks  
2. **Risk Evaluation:** Assessment based on likelihood, impact, and exposure  
3. **Treatment Strategies:** Divided into preventive, detective, and corrective measures  
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluating CSPs’ (Cloud Service Providers) security controls
